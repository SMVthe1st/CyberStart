We need you to write a script which can connect over TCP to the following server - localhost:10000 and send 'GET' to retrieve the encrypted messages. 
You then need to decrypt them and send them back split by \n. 
We think you'll receive 3 sentences, and that they're encrypted with a caesar cipher with a different random offset per sentence.

Finally, print the response after sending the decrypted messages to get the flag.

Tip: Remember, each encrypted message has a different random offset.
